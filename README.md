# Substance Abuse Dataset Analysis Report

## Project Overview

**Role:** Report Developer/Analyst

**Client Requirements/ Brief:**
- The client required an analysis report about the Substance Abuse dataset.
- The report should be concise, limited to one to two pages.
- The client prefers not to have an Intro Page but suggests vertical/horizontal navigation bars or a pop-up menu.
- The report should not be scrollable or in fancy shapes; it must fit well within a page, preferably in a 16:9 format.

## Introduction

This report presents an analysis of the Substance Abuse dataset, which comprises data in xlxs format. The analysis focuses on hospitalization programs, primary mental health diagnosis drivers, substances abused, and demographic insights related to mental health diagnoses. The objective is to provide valuable insights for decision-makers in the field of substance abuse and mental health services.

## Hospitalization Programs Comparison

We begin by comparing different hospitalization programs. The dataset includes information on various treatment programs, such as Usual Care and Intervention programs. Our analysis reveals the following key findings:

- **Usual Care:** Usual Care programs have a higher rate of enrolment, indicating that they offer a more structured and controlled environment for individuals seeking treatment and this accounts for 70% of patients.

- **Intervention:** Intervention programs are preferred by individuals with milder substance abuse issues, as they offer flexibility in terms of scheduling, and duration with 30% of patients choosing this option.

## Key Drivers of Primary Mental Health Diagnosis

Understanding the key drivers behind different types of primary mental health diagnoses is essential for tailored treatment. Our analysis identifies several common drivers:

- **Ethnicity:** Race plays a significant role in mental health diagnosis, particularly for conditions like depression and anxiety. For example, Depression is higher in Non-Hispanic white individuals, with native americans coming a close second.

- **Substance Abuse:** Substance abuse is closely linked to various mental health disorders, including mood disorders and schizophrenia, with Alcohol and opioids being the most frequently abused substances, accounting for [percentage].

## Demographic Analysis

Demographic analysis provides insights into the distribution of mental health diagnoses across different groups. Key demographic factors considered include age, gender, and race. The analysis indicates that:

- **Age:** Certain mental health diagnoses are more prevalent in specific age groups. For example, conditions like depression are more commonly diagnosed in the age group 30-49, while conditions like anxiety and psychosis are more prevalent in both 30-49 and 50-69 age groups.

- **Gender:** Gender disparities exist in mental health diagnoses, with all conditions such as depression, anxiety being more prevalent in males, accounting for at least 65% in every condition.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this report provides valuable insights into hospitalization programs, primary mental health diagnosis drivers, and demographic patterns within the Substance Abuse dataset. These findings can inform decision-making in the field of substance abuse and mental health services. However, it's important to note that further research and analysis may be required to gain a deeper understanding. Additionally, be aware of the dataset's limitations, such as [mention any limitations].
